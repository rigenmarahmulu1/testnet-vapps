## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: Momentum Yield
- **Category**: defi

### Description
The DeFi landscape on new networks is often fragmented and intimidating for new users.
Finding the best yield opportunities requires constant research and complex transaction management.
Momentum Yield tackles this by offering a simple, one-click solution for yield farming.
Users deposit a single asset (like ETH or a stablecoin), and our smart vaults automatically deploy this capital into the most optimal and secure yield strategies available on the Soundness Layer ecosystem.
It's designed to be the easiest on-ramp for anyone looking to put their assets to work on SL.

### SL Integration  
Momentum Yield is fundamentally a meta-protocol that lives on and enhances the Soundness Layer DeFi ecosystem. Our integration is deep:
- Core Logic: All our vaults and strategy contracts will be deployed directly on the Soundness Layer, providing transparency and security.
- Ecosystem Composability: The core function of our vaults is to interact with other SL DeFi primitivesâ€”we will be plugging into Soundness Layer DEXs for liquidity provision, lending protocols for borrowing, and other yield farms as they emerge.
- Gas Efficiency: We will leverage SL's architecture to ensure our strategy rebalancing operations are as gas-efficient as possible, maximizing returns for our users.

## Technical

### Architecture
The architecture is centered around a non-custodial smart contract system that users can interact with via a clean web interface.
- Vault Contracts: The primary user-facing contracts where users deposit and withdraw their assets. These contracts track user shares and delegate capital.
- Strategy Contracts: The "brain" of the operation. Each vault is linked to a strategy contract that contains the logic for interacting with other DeFi protocols (e.g., providing liquidity to a specific DEX pool).
- Keeper System: Off-chain bots (keepers) will monitor market conditions and call public functions on our contracts to trigger strategy rebalancing, ensuring vaults are always in the most optimal positions.

### Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React) with TypeScript, Wagmi for wallet connectivity, TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Backend**: A light Node.js/Express.js server, primarily for serving indexed on-chain data and running our keeper automation scripts.  
- **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer (Solidity).
- **Storage**: IPFS for hosting frontend builds and metadata; PostgreSQL for caching on-chain events for faster UI loading.

### Features
1. Single-Asset Deposit Vaults: The initial launch will feature vaults for core assets like wETH and USDC, abstracting away the complexity of LP pairing.
2. Automated Strategy Rebalancing: The system will automatically compound rewards and shift capital between different strategies to maximize APY.
3. User Dashboard: A clear and simple dashboard for users to track their deposited assets, historical earnings, and the current strategies their funds are deployed in.

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Deploy a single, non-upgradable vault contract for one asset (e.g., USDC).
- [ ] Implement a basic strategy that interacts with one target protocol on the SL testnet (e.g., a DEX).
- [ ] A simple UI for deposit and withdrawal functionality.

### MVP (4-8 weeks)  
- [ ] Develop multiple upgradable vault types for different assets.
- [ ] Build and test the off-chain keeper bot for automated rebalancing.
- [ ] Create the full user dashboard with performance analytics and historical data.
- [ ] Undergo a security audit of the core smart contracts.

## Innovation
While yield aggregators exist on mature chains, Momentum Yield's innovation lies in its role as a foundational "easy button" for the nascent Soundness Layer DeFi ecosystem.
By simplifying participation, we're not just offering a product; we are building a critical piece of infrastructure.
Our platform will help attract and retain new capital on Soundness Layer, bootstrap liquidity for emerging DEXs and protocols, and ultimately contribute to the network's overall growth and success.
We make the entire SL DeFi ecosystem more attractive and accessible.
